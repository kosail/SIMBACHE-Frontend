### **Sistema Mexicano de Bacheo y Conservación de Calles.**

A digital platform that empowers citizens and local governments to report, track, and manage pothole repairs efficiently across Mexico.

Kindly notice that although I wanted to make this a real product, I didn't have the time to do it and the deadline to present it was very tight. The code is horribly written and I'm not proud of it. Although, I hope it can be useful for someone.
